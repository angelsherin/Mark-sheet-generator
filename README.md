# Mark-sheet-generator
The Marksheet Generator using UiPath is a robotic process automation (RPA) solution designed to automate the tedious and error-prone process of generating student mark sheets.
UiPath, a leading RPA platform, empowers this automation by streamlining the collection of student data, calculating marks, and generating structured mark sheets in various formats.
The automation begins by presenting a user-friendly interface that prompts the user to input student details such as name, roll number, and subject-wise marks. UiPath's Form Designer facilitates the creation of this intuitive interface, enhancing user experience.

Once the data is collected, the automation processes it using UiPath's data manipulation capabilities. It calculates essential metrics like total marks, average marks, and possibly even grades based on predefined criteria.
At last the marksheet of a particular student is sent to their mail.
